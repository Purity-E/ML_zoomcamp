PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

We are living in a digital world and this can be seen by the fact that more and more companies and organizations around the world are adopting digital techniques to help run their activities.
Creating and using apps has been one of the major ways in which companies are adopting digital techniques. With more and more apps being made, the big question is; Will an app be successful after it has been made?

The objective of this project is to determine how successful an app will be.

One of the ways to determine how successful an app is, is the user rating. This project will entail building a machine learning model that predicts the user rating an app will get. The best model will be the one that has the lowest Root Mean Squared Error of the predicted user rating and the actual user rating.
