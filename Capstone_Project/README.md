Mental health is a person's emotional, social and psychological well being. Mental health affects our daily activities from how we feel to we behave amd to how we relate with people. People do have different attitudes and opinions towards mental health and a certain number would not consider to form habits that would preserve mental well being or even consider seeking treatment for it.

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a person will seek mental health in the tech workplace. We will explore the factors that would likely influence a person's decision to seek treatment for mental health condition and then use the strongest predictors to create a classification model. The best model will be one that produces a good ROC curve.
