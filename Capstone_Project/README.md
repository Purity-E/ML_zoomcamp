PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Mental health is a person's emotional, social and psychological well being. Mental health affects our daily activities, from how we feel, to how we behave and to how we relate with people. People do have different attitudes and opinions towards mental health and a certain number would not consider forming habits that would preserve mental well being or even consider seeking treatment for mental health.

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a person in the tech workplace will seek mental health, based on features such as work interference among others. We will explore the factors that would likely influence a person's decision to seek treatment for mental health condition and then use the strongest predictors to create a classification model. The best model will be one that produces a good ROC curve.
